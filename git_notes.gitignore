Git commands:

To add a git repo from your local working directory to your remote directory,
you use : git remote add origin(origin is the name of your remote).
so again : git remote add origin (link of your repo).

to push repo from working to remote. we use the command:

git push -u origin master.
origin = remote name
master = branch.(default branch in this case).
